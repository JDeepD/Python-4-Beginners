## Your PR must have the following criteria for being accepted.

1. Must contain meaningful python code snippets with well documented comments
2. No PRs containing modified pre existing files will be accepted.
3. No `.md` or `.txt` files will be accepted.
4. It is recommended that you put your file in one of  the pre existing folders of the repository. You can also make your own folder if you think your code doesn't falls in any of the folders.
